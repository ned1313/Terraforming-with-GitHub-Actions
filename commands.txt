## You're going to need the Azure CLI
## And you're going to need Azure AD permissions to create a service principal

## Log into Azure and select the correct subscription
az login
az account set -s SUBSCRIPTION_NAME

# Go into the remote-setup folder
cd remote-setup

# Set a GitHub token

export GITHUB_TOKEN=TOKEN_VALUE

$env:GITHUB_TOKEN="TOKEN_VALUE"

## Let's initialize our remote setup
terraform init

## Now plan and apply the configuration
terraform plan -out remote.tfplan
terraform apply remote.tfplan

## From here we should be able to create a branch, pull request, and push to create infrastructure

git checkout -B reindeer

## Make a change and push the commit to remote

## See it FAIL

## Fix and push again

## Success!

## Create a PR and wait for actions to complete

## Merge the PR and see creation of infrastructure

## Create a new branch to fix a tag value

## Go through the process again
